 * Intersecting wires problem: There are many wires connecting ports on two
 * switches. Wires are straight lines and no two wires share the same port on a
 * switch. We want to know the number of intersection points created by these
 * wires. This is actually an inversion counting problem.
 * 
 * This class computes the number of intersection points.
