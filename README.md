#Intersecting Wires

There are many wires connecting ports on two switches. Wires are straight lines and no two wires share the same port on a switch. We want to know the number of intersection points created by these wires. This is actually an inversion counting problem.

- wiresL.java - it gives a list of wires that are the longest in length.
- wiresI.java - it computes the number of intersection points.
